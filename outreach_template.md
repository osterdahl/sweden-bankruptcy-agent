## Body

Dear {{trustee_name}},

We noticed that {{company_name}} recently entered bankruptcy proceedings.

Redpine specializes in acquiring data assets from companies in transition — including source code, media rights, engineering drawings, sensor data, and research datasets — and licensing them to AI developers and model builders.

If the estate holds any digital assets of this nature, we would welcome a brief conversation about whether there is an opportunity to generate value for creditors.

Happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
David Österdahl
Redpine
