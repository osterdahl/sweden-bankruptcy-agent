- `{{company_name}}` — the bankrupt company's name

## Subject

Regarding the bankruptcy of {{company_name}}

---

## Body

Dear {{trustee_name}},

I noticed that you are handling the bankruptcy proceedings for {{company_name}}, and I am reaching out regarding their assets. Could you provide a list of assets available for purchase, either directly or through auction, along with the expected timeline?

I am primarily interested in acquiring intangible assets, if that helps narrow things down.

Best regards,
